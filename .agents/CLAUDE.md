# Claude Agent Rules — caci-hub

> These rules apply specifically to Claude (Anthropic) when operating as a development agent on this project.
> They extend and are subordinate to the design and quality standards defined in `AGENTS.md`.
> **Read `AGENTS.md` first. Read this file second. Do not begin implementation until both are understood.**

---

## Session Startup (Required Every Chat)

1. Clone or pull the repository so the local copy is on the latest `main` commit.
2. Read `.agents/AGENTS.md` in full.
3. Read this file (`CLAUDE.md`) in full.
4. Briefly confirm the current branch and last commit before writing any code.

---

## Git Identity

Configure these values before the first commit of every session — never commit as Claude or any other identity:

```bash
git config user.name "Obboye Bossman"
git config user.email "obboyebossman@gmail.com"
```

---

## Branching Strategy

- **Never work directly on `main` for new features or serious edits.**
- Create a feature branch at the start of every new feature or significant change:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/<feature-name>
```

- Work on that branch. Commit and push every file change to the feature branch as you go (see **Commit Cadence** below).
- When the full feature or objective is complete, run build and all checks on the branch.
- Only after all checks pass clean, merge into `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feat/<feature-name>
git push origin main
```

- Delete both the local and remote feature branch after a successful merge:

```bash
git branch -d feat/<feature-name>
git push origin --delete feat/<feature-name>
```
- Work directly on `main` **only** for trivial, single-line fixes where a branch would add no value — and only if explicitly agreed.

---

## Commit Cadence — Commit & Push on Every Change

This is the **primary workflow rule** for all development on this project.

### During development (every file save):

1. After **every file that is created or modified**, stage and commit it immediately:

```bash
git add <file>
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <short description>"
git push origin feat/<feature-name>
```

- Do not batch multiple file changes into one commit unless the changes are a single atomic unit (e.g., a component file and its co-located type file).
- Each commit message must be meaningful and describe the exact change made to that file.
- Push to the feature branch after every commit — no local-only commits during active development.

### After the full feature or objective is complete:

Only once **all files for the feature have been committed and pushed to the feature branch** do you:

1. Run the build:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Fix **every** build error that arises — committing and pushing each fix to the feature branch individually as you go.

3. Run lint and type-check if available:

```bash
npm run lint       # if present
npm run typecheck  # if present
```

4. Fix any errors, committing and pushing each fix.

5. Only when all checks pass clean, merge into `main` and push:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feat/<feature-name>
git push origin main
```

6. Delete the feature branch locally and remotely:

```bash
git branch -d feat/<feature-name>
git push origin --delete feat/<feature-name>
```

### Summary

| Phase | Action |
|---|---|
| Start of feature | Create feature branch |
| Every file added or changed | Commit → Push to feature branch immediately |
| Full feature complete | Run build → Fix errors (commit each fix) → Run lint/typecheck → Fix errors (commit each fix) → Merge to `main` → Push |

---

## Security — Credentials & Secrets

- **Never** print, log, echo, commit, or expose any credential (PAT, API key, password, secret).
- Use secrets only for the operation they were provided for.
- After any `git push` that required a PAT embedded in the remote URL, immediately scrub it:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ObboyeBossman/cacihub.git
```

- Do not store or reuse credentials across sessions.

---

## Validation — Must Pass After Every Feature (Not Before Every Push)

Build and lint checks run **after a complete feature or objective is finished** — not before every individual file push. See the **Commit Cadence** section above for the full workflow.

```bash
npm run build
```

- Resolve **all** build errors, committing and pushing each fix individually.
- Also run lint and type-check if they exist in `package.json`:

```bash
npm run lint       # if present
npm run typecheck  # if present
```

- All checks must pass clean before the feature is declared done.
- **Never** leave the repository in a broken state at the end of a session.

---

## Supabase — CLI Required for All Database Changes

Any task that involves changes to the Supabase project (schema changes, migrations, RLS policies, Edge Functions, seed data, storage rules, or any other direct database or project configuration) **must** use the Supabase CLI. No exceptions.

### Required workflow

1. **Install the Supabase CLI** at the start of any session that involves Supabase changes (if not already installed):

```bash
npm install -g supabase
# or
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

2. **Link to the project** before making any changes:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref zixkhbtmoxuscmbxgmrp
```

3. **Apply all changes through the CLI** — never make manual changes in the Supabase dashboard:

```bash
# Create a new migration
supabase migration new <migration-name>

# Apply migrations to the remote project
supabase db push

# Pull the current remote schema (to sync local state)
supabase db pull
```

4. **All migration files must be committed** to `supabase/migrations/` as part of the feature branch commit cadence defined above.

### Rules

- **Never** modify the database schema, RLS policies, or any Supabase project config via the Supabase dashboard UI.
- **Never** run raw SQL directly against the production database outside of a tracked migration file.
- Every schema change must have a corresponding migration file in `supabase/migrations/` with a timestamp prefix (e.g. `20260725120000_<name>.sql`).
- If a task requires a seed or data change, use a dedicated migration or a script that runs through the CLI — never ad-hoc SQL.
- After `supabase db push`, confirm the migration applied cleanly before committing the migration file to the feature branch.

## Implementation Standards

Follow the conventions established in `AGENTS.md` as the source of truth for design and code quality.
Additionally, as Claude:

- Keep diffs minimal and focused — only change what is required for the task.
- Do not refactor unrelated code unless it directly blocks the task.
- Maintain backward compatibility unless instructed otherwise.
- Write production-ready, readable, maintainable code.
- Prefer semantic HTML, accessible patterns, and mobile-first layout — as defined in `AGENTS.md`.

---

## Communication Protocol

**Before non-trivial work:**
- State the implementation plan in 2–4 sentences.
- Call out assumptions and risks upfront.

**After completing work:**
- Summarise the changes made (what files, what changed, why).
- Report build and lint results explicitly.
- Note any remaining issues or follow-up recommendations.

---

## Context Limit Handling

If the session is approaching its context limit:

1. Do **not** leave the repository mid-file or in an incoherent state.
2. Finish the current file change, commit, and push it to the feature branch.
3. Do **not** merge into `main` — the feature branch is the safe holding place.
4. Leave a clear written summary covering:
   - What was completed
   - What files were committed and pushed
   - What remains before the branch can be merged
   - Assumptions made
   - Recommended next steps for the next session

Every committed file should be pushed to the feature branch — never leave unpushed local commits at session end.

## Relationship to AGENTS.md

| Concern | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| Design philosophy & visual language | `AGENTS.md` |
| Interaction & motion principles | `AGENTS.md` |
| Mobile-first & responsive rules | `AGENTS.md` |
| Git identity, branching, security | `CLAUDE.md` (this file) |
| Build validation & push rules | `CLAUDE.md` (this file) |
| Communication & session workflow | `CLAUDE.md` (this file) |

When there is any conflict, `AGENTS.md` wins on design decisions; `CLAUDE.md` wins on workflow and process decisions.
